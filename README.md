# Library-Management-System
The Library Management System simplifies library operations by managing books, members, and borrowing processes.

I am excited to share the Library Management System project that was developed as part of the Nuronetix Python Internship Hackathon. This project demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Python to build a console-based application that automates library management functions.

The system consists of three key classes: Book, Member, and Library, each designed to manage specific operations within the library. The Book class stores information about each book, including attributes like book ID, title, author, genre, and availability. The Member class manages details about library members and tracks the books they have borrowed. Finally, the Library class serves as the central controller, handling the catalog of books, registering members, and processing book borrowing and returns.

One of the core features of the system is its borrow and return functionality, where users can borrow a book and have an automatic due date assigned. The system tracks overdue books and calculates late fees when necessary. The system also generates reports, such as listing all borrowed books, identifying overdue books, and showing the most popular books based on borrow count. These reports provide valuable insights to the library on book usage and member activity.

A key aspect of the project was using Python's file handling capabilities to store data persistently. This means that information about books and members is saved to text files, ensuring that data is not lost between program sessions. We also implemented robust error handling to ensure a smooth user experience, addressing common issues like invalid inputs and non-existent members or books.

The project strengthened our skills in Python, particularly in applying OOP concepts and file handling. We also gained experience in error management and developing a modular system. Moving forward, we aim to improve the project by integrating a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter or PyQt and replacing file-based storage with a database solution like SQLite or MySQL for better scalability.

We are proud of what we achieved and look forward to exploring future improvements. Thank you for checking out our project!
